# BLASTPad

**BLASTPad** is a macropad – a programmable keyboard with 23 customazible keys and 2 encoders (knobs). 

# Instruction

## Layout





![top_view_description](/resources/top_view_description.png)





Keyborad's layout was designed to resamble the most left 5 columns of a standard keyborad with the exclusion of the top row (which usually contains all the _F_ keys together with _ESC_ key ). All of the keys are programmable, which means that with the help of a small desktop app you will be able to change behaviour of each key by assigning keystroke combinations to all of them.  Additionally **BlastPad** has two rotary encoders, which also can trigger some keystroke actions.

## First Run

1. Connect your **BLASTPad** to your computer via USB MICRO B cable. New usb storage device called **BLASTPAD** should appear. We will talk about it more later.
2. Wait until **BLAST** logo will disappear.
3. You should see the similar data on the display:

![Default-Display](/Photos/Default-Display.png)

- "Default" is a title of currently active **Preset**.
- "Numbers" is a title of an **Encoder Action** currently assigned to the **Encoder 1**
- "Up/Down" is a title of an **Encoder Action** currently assigned to the **Encoder 2**

### Encoder Basics

In next the chapter we will talk more about **Presets** and how to set them up together with the **Key and Encoder Actions**.  For now let's focus on the behaviour of the latter.

#### Changing the Encoder Actions:

Push the knob like it were a button.

You can see on the display that encoder changed it's title and therefore it changed its behaviour. Each **Preset** has its own set of "behaviours" that can be assigned to eighter **Encoder 1** or **Encoder 2** (see chapter **Creating and editing Presets** to learn how to create those behaviours).



There are two **types of Encoder Actions**:



- **Left/right Action**

  >  In this action you have assigned two keystrokes to the encoder: one to the counterclockwise and the other one to the cockwise movements.
  >
  > Good example is the "Up/Down" action. Left movement performs "UP ARROW" keystroke, while right movement performs "DOWN ARROW" keystroke. Test it, for example, in some text editor. You will see that the cursor behaves in a similar way, as you would hit the arrow buttons.

- **Carousel Action**

  >"Numbers" is a good example of a carousel action. In this action when you rotate knob clockwise, it will execute numerical keystroke. With every step the keystroke will represent incremented digit starting from *0* (zero) until it will reach the *9*. After this, the counting will reset to *0*.
  >
  >If you'll rotate know counterclockwise, the operation will work almost the same. Except, this time instead of incrementing, it will decrement digits.

  

## Creating and editing Presets

**Preset** is a singular set of instructions, which determines what keystroke sequence will be triggered by your keys or encoders. You can store almost as many presets on your **BlastPad** as you want.



#### Maximum number of actions in the Preset:

Each **Preset** has actions assigned to the keys, which max number in the preset is equal to the number of the buttons in **BLASTPad**'s keyboard layout (23 – excluding the special lonely key on the right side of the device). Besides **Key Actions**, each preset can have **Encoder Actions**. Number of those is in theory limitless. You can switch between all of **Preset**'s **Encoder Actions** with just two physical encoders. 

#### BlastPadControl app
